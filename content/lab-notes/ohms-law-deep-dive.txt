Ohm's Law is the bedrock of electrical engineering. It describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a conductor. Let's explore it properly.

[heading] The Basic Relationship

[text]
At its core, Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance.

[latex]
V = I \cdot R

[text]
Where **V** is voltage in *volts* (V), **I** is current in *amperes* (A), and **R** is resistance in *ohms* (Ω).

[heading] Power Dissipation

[text]
Combining Ohm's Law with the power equation gives us useful variants:

[latex]
P = V \cdot I = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}

[text]
This is critical when designing circuits — you need to know how much power a resistor will dissipate to choose the right wattage rating.

[heading] ## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

[text]
In any closed loop of a circuit, the sum of all voltages must equal zero:

[latex]
\sum_{k=1}^{n} V_k = 0

[text]
This is essentially conservation of energy applied to circuits. Walk around any loop, and you'll return to the same potential you started at.

[heading] Practical Example

[text]
Consider a simple series circuit with a 9V battery and two resistors: R₁ = 330Ω and R₂ = 670Ω.

[code]
Total Resistance: R_total = R1 + R2 = 330 + 670 = 1000 Ω
Current:          I = V / R = 9 / 1000 = 9 mA
Voltage at R1:    V1 = I × R1 = 0.009 × 330 = 2.97 V
Voltage at R2:    V2 = I × R2 = 0.009 × 670 = 6.03 V
Check KVL:        V1 + V2 = 2.97 + 6.03 = 9.0 V ✓

"The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another." — But for circuits, Ohm's Law is where it all begins.

Understanding these fundamentals deeply is the key to tackling more complex topics like AC analysis, impedance, and filter design. Keep experimenting!
