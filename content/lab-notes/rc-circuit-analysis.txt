[text]
The RC circuit is one of the most fundamental building blocks in electronics. It's used in filters, timing circuits, and signal conditioning. Let's break down its transient behavior.

[heading] Circuit Setup

[text]
An RC circuit consists of a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) connected in series with a voltage source. When the switch closes, the capacitor begins to charge.

[heading] Charging Equation

[text]
The voltage across the capacitor as a function of time during charging:

[latex]
V_C(t) = V_S \left(1 - e^{-t/\tau}\right)

[text]
Where the **time constant** τ is:

[latex]
\tau = R \cdot C

[text]
After one time constant (τ), the capacitor reaches approximately **63.2%** of the supply voltage. After 5τ, it's considered fully charged (~99.3%).

[heading] Discharging Equation

[text]
When the source is removed, the capacitor discharges through the resistor:

[latex]
V_C(t) = V_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau}

[heading] Energy Stored

[text]
The energy stored in a capacitor at any point:

[latex]
E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2

[heading] Practical Example

[code]
Given: R = 10 kΩ, C = 100 μF, Vs = 5V
τ = R × C = 10,000 × 0.0001 = 1.0 second

At t = 1s:  Vc = 5 × (1 - e^(-1))   ≈ 3.16 V
At t = 2s:  Vc = 5 × (1 - e^(-2))   ≈ 4.32 V
At t = 5s:  Vc = 5 × (1 - e^(-5))   ≈ 4.97 V

[list]
- τ = 1 second for this circuit
- After 3τ = 95% charged
- After 5τ = 99.3% charged (effectively full)

RC circuits appear everywhere — from debouncing buttons to audio crossover networks. Master the exponential, and you master a huge chunk of analog electronics.
