There's something deeply satisfying about hearing music come out of a circuit you built from individual transistors. This is my Class-AB audio amplifier build — no op-amps, no ICs, just discrete components.

[heading] Design Goals

[list]
- Output power: ~1W into 8Ω speaker
- THD < 1% at moderate volume
- Single supply: 12V DC
- Minimal component count

[heading] Circuit Topology

[text]
The amplifier uses a classic complementary symmetry output stage with a **voltage amplifier stage** (VAS) and a **differential input pair** for stability.

[text]
The output transistors are NPN (TIP31C) and PNP (TIP32C) in a push-pull configuration. A **Vbe multiplier** provides the bias voltage to minimize crossover distortion.

[heading] Key Calculations

[text]
Maximum output voltage swing:

[latex]
V_{out(peak)} = V_{CC} - V_{CE(sat)} - V_{dropout} \approx 12 - 1 - 1 = 10\,V_{peak}

[text]
Power delivered to 8Ω load:

[latex]
P = \frac{V_{rms}^2}{R_L} = \frac{(10/\sqrt{2})^2}{8} = \frac{50}{8} \approx 6.25\,W

[text]
In practice, with biasing and real-world losses, I get around **1-2W clean** output, which is plenty for a desktop speaker.

[heading] Biasing the Output Stage

[text]
The Vbe multiplier sets the quiescent current to about 10-20mA to keep the transistors slightly conducting, reducing crossover distortion:

[latex]
V_{bias} = V_{BE} \times \left(1 + \frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)

[code]
Quiescent current: Iq = Vbias / (2 × Re)
With Vbias = 1.4V and Re = 47Ω:
Iq = 1.4 / (2 × 47) ≈ 14.9 mA ✓

[heading] Results

[text]
The amp sounds *great* for what it is — warm, slightly colored (in a good way), and surprisingly detailed for a discrete design. It reminds me of those old hi-fi amps from the 70s and 80s.

Next I want to add a tone control stage and maybe a headphone output. The discrete analog journey continues!
