excerpt: Building a scrolling text display using an 8x8 LED matrix, shift registers, and an ATmega328P.

[text]
I've always wanted to build a scrolling text LED display — that classic 80s airport/stock-ticker vibe. Here's how I put one together with minimal parts.

[heading] Components

[list]
- 8x8 LED matrix (common cathode)
- 2× 74HC595 shift registers
- ATmega328P (or Arduino Uno)
- 8× 220Ω current-limiting resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 5V power supply

[heading] How It Works

[text]
The LED matrix has 8 rows and 8 columns, giving us 64 individually addressable LEDs. We use **multiplexing** to drive them — only one row is active at a time, but we cycle through them so fast (>60Hz) that persistence of vision makes it look like they're all on.

[text]
The 74HC595 shift registers let us control all 16 lines (8 rows + 8 columns) using only 3 GPIO pins: **data**, **clock**, and **latch**.

[heading] Key Formula

[text]
Current limiting resistor value for each LED:

[latex]
R = \frac{V_{CC} - V_{LED}}{I_{LED}} = \frac{5 - 2}{0.015} = 200\,\Omega

[text]
I went with 220Ω (nearest standard value), giving us about 13.6mA per LED — perfectly safe and bright.

[heading] Shift Register Timing

[code]
// Pseudocode for one frame
for (row = 0; row < 8; row++) {
    shiftOut(columnData[row]);  // Send column pattern
    shiftOut(1 << row);         // Activate current row
    latchPulse();               // Update outputs
    delay_us(1000);             // Hold for 1ms
    clearOutputs();             // Turn off before next row
}

[heading] Scrolling Logic

[text]
Each character is stored as an 8-byte array (one byte per column). To scroll, we shift the display buffer left by one column every ~80ms, and append the next column of the next character.

The result? A beautiful scrolling text display that could've come straight out of a 1985 electronics magazine. Sometimes the simplest builds are the most satisfying.

Total cost was under $10, and it took an afternoon to build. Next up: making it WiFi-connected with an ESP8266 so it can display live data!
