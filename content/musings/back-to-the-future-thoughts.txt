excerpt: Why Back to the Future is the perfect 80s movie and what it means to me as an engineer.

If you're into electrical engineering and you don't love *Back to the Future*, we need to talk. This movie is basically a love letter to tinkering, building, and the sheer joy of making things work.

[heading] Doc Brown — The Engineer Hero

[text]
Doc Brown is every engineer's spirit animal. He's eccentric, passionate, obsessed with his work, and absolutely convinced that his crazy idea will work. And you know what? *It does*.

That line isn't just cool — it's the engineering mindset distilled into one sentence. We're always building toward a future that doesn't exist yet.

[heading] The Flux Capacitor

[text]
Let's talk about the elephant in the room. The flux capacitor requires 1.21 gigawatts of power. Let's put that in perspective:

[latex]
1.21\,\text{GW} = 1.21 \times 10^9\,\text{W}

[text]
That's roughly the output of a nuclear power plant. Or, as Doc figured out, one bolt of lightning.

The energy stored in the lightning bolt:

[latex]
E = P \times t \approx 1.21 \times 10^9 \times 0.001 = 1.21 \times 10^6\,\text{J} \approx 1.21\,\text{MJ}

[text]
That's actually... not that much energy. About the same as a stick of dynamite. The trick isn't the *energy* — it's the *power* (energy per unit time). Lightning delivers a modest amount of energy at an absolutely insane rate.

[heading] Favorite Moments

[list]
- The DeLorean hitting 88 mph for the first time
- The clock tower scene — peak tension
- Doc's expression when the flux capacitor actually works
- "This is heavy." / "Weight has nothing to do with it."
- The entire skateboard chase scene

[heading] What It Means

[text]
Beyond the time travel and the laughs, *Back to the Future* is about the idea that your future isn't written yet. You have the power to change it. That message hits different when you're an engineer — because building a better future is literally what we do.

Great Scott, I love this movie. If you haven't watched it in a while, fire it up. It holds up perfectly — just like a well-designed circuit.
